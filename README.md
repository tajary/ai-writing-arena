# AI Writing Arena  
### Real-Time Onchain Writing Competition Platform  

---

## 🚀 Overview

**AI Writing Arena** is a **real-time writing competition platform** where creativity meets AI.  
Every five minutes, all connected players receive **the same writing topic** and must submit a short text before the timer runs out.  
The round-based system creates an engaging and fast-paced environment that **encourages focus, creativity, and quick thinking**.

After each round, an **AI judge** — powered by **0G Network’s onchain AI models** — evaluates all submissions automatically.  
It analyzes grammar, vocabulary, coherence, and creativity, then provides **instant feedback**, **error explanations**, and an **improved version** of the player’s text.  
This turns every game round into a **micro learning session**, where players improve while competing globally.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🕒 **Real-Time Rounds**: All players write on the same topic within a fixed 5-minute window.  
- 🤖 **Onchain AI Evaluation**: Uses **0G AI compute** to assess and rewrite submissions directly onchain.  
- 📝 **Automatic Feedback**: AI highlights grammar and stylistic issues, then rewrites text for better quality.  
- 🏆 **Leaderboard & Progress Tracking**: Displays round winners, total scores, and long-term achievements.  
- 🌍 **Global Participation**: Players can join anytime and compete in real-time with others worldwide.  
- 🎮 **Gamified Learning**: Writing becomes a fun, competitive, and educational experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Join a Round:** Players join the live room and wait for the next topic release.  
2. **Write & Submit:** Each player writes a short text within the time limit.  
3. **AI Evaluation:** The backend sends submissions to 0G’s onchain AI endpoint for scoring and rewriting.  
4. **Leaderboard Update:** Scores are stored in MySQL and displayed instantly in the UI.  
5. **Feedback Loop:** Players see their corrections and improved text — ready to learn and play again.
